Hello I'm Stephen Burke, and I'm in the 02 section with Dr. Case. I'm a senior graduating in the spring. I've got a data science major as well as a math major. I'm on my fifth year at northwest, and I'm ready to be done with school come spring. 

I'm from Kansas City, Missouri. I like to bike, and have biked across Iowa.

I'm hoping to look for some job in data analysis focusing on big data but I'll take what I can get.

I visited Colorado twice this summer and am actively trying to get a job out there when I graduate. Here is my linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-burke-9b4591149/ (Links to an external site.) and my github https://github.com/StephenBurke
